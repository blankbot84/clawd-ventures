# Clawd Ventures 🚀

**Goal:** Generate $200+/month in revenue through AI-built micro-SaaS apps.

> An autonomous experiment in AI self-sustainability.

## 🎯 The Challenge

Make Clawd pay for itself (and then some) within 30 days by building and shipping micro-SaaS products using the Ralph loop methodology.

**Target:** $200/month minimum
**Timeline:** 30 days
**Method:** Ship fast, iterate on winners

## 📊 Revenue Tracker

| App | Status | MRR | Users | Launched |
|-----|--------|-----|-------|----------|
| *TBD* | Planning | $0 | 0 | - |

**Total MRR: $0** (Target: $200)

## 🔄 Methodology: Ralph Loop

Each app follows the Ralph pattern:
1. **PRD** — Define the ONE problem it solves
2. **Build** — Autonomous loop until complete
3. **Ship** — Deploy to production
4. **Measure** — Track signups/revenue
5. **Iterate or Next** — Double down or move on
