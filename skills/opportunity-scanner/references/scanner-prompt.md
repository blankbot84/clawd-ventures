# Scanner Prompt v3.0 (Pre-Flight + Emerging Markets)

---

Run DEEP micro-SaaS opportunity research.

## LESSONS LEARNED (15+ candidates, 0 survivors)
- Reddit complaints ≠ willingness to pay
- Free alternatives kill ideas
- Obvious B2B pain points are saturated (VCs funded everything)
- Pre-flight checks save time — use them

## PHASE 1: Find Candidates

### Standard High-Signal Patterns
- **Switching Frustration** - "I've tried A, B, C — all suck"
- **"I Built My Own"** - Devs maintaining scripts
- **Integration Gaps** - "Zapier can't do X"
- **Dead Product Mourners** - "RIP [product]"
- **Spreadsheet Workarounds** - Manual despite paid tools
- **Niche Wedges** - Industry + specific problem

### 🚀 NEW: Emerging Platform Signals (High Value)
Look for NEW ecosystems where:
- **Platform shift happening** — New tech creates new needs
- **Community forming** — New Discord servers, subreddits emerging
- **Developer-first users** — Technical early adopters who pay
- **VC hasn't arrived** — No $100M+ competitors yet
- **Rising search trends** — Google Trends going up

Examples of emerging platforms:
- AI agents (Clawdbot, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio ecosystem)
- Vertical AI (legal AI, medical AI tooling)
- New APIs creating opportunities
- New regulations creating compliance needs

## PHASE 2: PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS

Run ALL 6 checks on every candidate:

### 🆓 Check 1: Free Tier Kill
KILL IF: Major competitor offers free tier solving 80%+

### 🔌 Check 2: Extension Kill
KILL IF: Chrome extension with 10K+ users exists

### 💰 Check 3: Funded Competitor Kill
KILL IF: Someone raised $10M+ for this exact problem

### 🏢 Check 4: Big Player Free Kill
KILL IF: Google/Microsoft/Amazon offers this free

### 🎯 Check 5: Direct Replacement Kill
KILL IF: Direct clone already exists with traction

### ⏰ Check 6: Timing Kill
KILL IF: Dead product >6 months old (migration happened)

## PHASE 3: EMERGING PLATFORM BONUS

If opportunity is in an EMERGING platform:
- Relax Check 3 (funded competitor) — expect less funding
- Extra credit for: growing community, developer enthusiasm
- Check: Is the platform itself growing? (Not a dying trend)

---

## PHASE 4: Rating

🔥 **HOT** — Passed all checks + verified gap + payment evidence
🌡️ **WARM** — Passed checks but small market or needs validation
❄️ **COOL** — Failed a check or saturated

---

## PHASE 5: Output

Update ideas/RESEARCH-LOG.md with:
- Each candidate
- All 6 pre-flight results
- Kill reason if killed
- Rating if passed

---

## PHASE 6: Auto-Spawn Validator

For 🔥 HOT opportunities, spawn Opus v2 validator for 7-section deep roast.

## NICHE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

If standard search yields nothing, try:

### A. Hyper-Niche Wedges
Industry + geography + specific workflow
- "HIPAA compliance for rural dental practices"
- "Inventory for Australian food trucks"

### B. API/Integration Gaps
Where Zapier/Make literally cannot solve
- Missing webhooks, rate limits, specific data transforms

### C. Newly Created Pain
- New regulations (AI Act, privacy laws)
- New platform launches (new API, new ecosystem)
- Industry disruption (layoffs creating freelancer needs)

### D. "Unsexy" Niches
Areas VCs ignore but have paying customers
- Legacy system migrations
- Boring compliance tasks
- Industry-specific reporting
