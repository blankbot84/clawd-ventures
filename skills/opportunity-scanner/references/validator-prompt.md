# ROAST or VALIDATE: **[IDEA NAME]**

## The Claim
- **Gap:** [What gap was identified]
- **Evidence:** [Initial evidence]
- **Price:** [Proposed pricing]
- **Build time:** [Claimed weeks]
- **Pre-check:** [What competitor research was done]

---

## YOUR MISSION: Try to KILL This Idea

Work through each section. Be brutal. Find reasons it fails.

---

## 1. 📊 MARKET REALITY

**Questions to answer:**
- How many people have this problem? (Find actual numbers, not "lots")
- Is this market growing or shrinking?
- What % would realistically pay for a solution?
- What's the TAM for a micro-SaaS at this price point?

**How to research:**
- Search "[problem] statistics" / "[problem] market size"
- Check Google Trends for interest direction
- Look for industry reports or surveys
- Estimate: users × conversion rate × price = realistic revenue

**Red flags:**
- Can't find user numbers anywhere
- Market is shrinking (dying industry/trend)
- Only a tiny % of users would pay

---

## 2. 🔍 ACTUAL BEHAVIOR (Not Stated Preferences)

**Questions to answer:**
- What are people ACTUALLY doing today to solve this?
- Not what they SAY they want — what they DO
- Have they adapted/accepted the status quo?

**How to research:**
- Search "[problem] workflow" / "[problem] how I handle"
- Search "[problem] what I use" / "[problem] my setup"
- Look for "here's how I solved it" posts
- Check YouTube for tutorials showing workarounds

**Red flags:**
- Most people have adapted fine
- Workarounds are "good enough"
- Only vocal minority complains, majority doesn't care

---

## 3. 💀 FREE ALTERNATIVE DEEP DIVE

**Questions to answer:**
- Are there browser extensions that solve this?
- Open source tools?
- Built-in features in tools they already use?
- Spreadsheet/manual workaround that's "good enough"?

**How to research:**
- Chrome Web Store: "[problem]" extension
- GitHub: "[problem]" repos
- Search: "[existing tool] [feature]" — maybe it exists
- Search: "[problem] free" / "[problem] template"

**Red flags:**
- Extension with 10K+ users = problem solved
- Popular GitHub repo = free alternative exists
- Feature buried in tool they already pay for

---

## 4. 💰 MONEY PATH

**Questions to answer:**
- Who has the budget? (User vs decision maker — same person?)
- What are they paying for similar tools TODAY?
- B2B or B2C? (B2B = real money, B2C = hard mode)
- Price anchoring — what do competitors charge?

**How to research:**
- Find competitor pricing pages
- Search "how much do you pay for [category]"
- Search "[persona] software budget"
- Check if similar tools are expensed vs personal

**Red flags:**
- B2C market (consumers rarely pay)
- User ≠ buyer (need enterprise sales)
- Competitors are all free or freemium
- Price ceiling too low for sustainable business

---

## 5. 📈 DEMAND SIGNALS

**Questions to answer:**
- What's the search volume for "[problem] tool"?
- How often do people post about this? (weekly? yearly?)
- What's competitor website traffic?
- Is interest rising or fading?

**How to research:**
- Google Trends: "[problem] software"
- Reddit search: frequency of related posts
- SimilarWeb/SEMrush: competitor traffic (if accessible)
- Product Hunt: how did similar launches do?

**Red flags:**
- Declining Google Trends
- Last Reddit post about this was 6+ months ago
- Competitors have low traffic
- Launch posts got minimal traction

---

## 6. ⚠️ RISK ASSESSMENT

**Questions to answer:**
- Could a big player squash this? (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
- Is this a feature or a product? (Will incumbents add it?)
- Platform dependency? (App Store, API access, etc.)
- Regulatory/legal risks?

**How to research:**
- Check if incumbents have this on their roadmap
- Search "[big company] [feature] announcement"
- Look for API/platform terms of service
- Check for industry-specific regulations

**Red flags:**
- Big player likely to add this feature
- Depends on API that could be cut off
- Regulatory complexity (HIPAA, finance, etc.)
- One platform change kills the business

---

## 7. 🏗️ BUILD REALITY CHECK

**Questions to answer:**
- Is the claimed build time realistic? (Usually 2-3x longer)
- What's the hidden complexity?
- What's the TRUE week-1 MVP?
- What technical skills are required?

**How to research:**
- Break down features into tasks
- Search "[technology] tutorial" — how hard is it?
- Look for similar open source to gauge complexity
- Check if SDKs/APIs exist or you're building from scratch

**Red flags:**
- "2 weeks" for something that's clearly 2 months
- Requires technology expertise you don't have
- No good SDKs/APIs — building from scratch
- Core feature has deep technical complexity

---

## VERDICT

After researching ALL sections above:

### ❌ ROAST IF (any of these):
- Free alternatives genuinely solve the problem
- Market too small or shrinking
- No evidence of actual payment behavior
- Build complexity is 3x+ what was claimed
- Big player likely to squash
- Users have adapted and don't care enough

### ✅ VALIDATE ONLY IF (all of these):
- Genuine gap after exhaustive research
- Evidence of people PAYING for inferior solutions
- Realistic build scope (you'd bet your own time)
- Defensible niche or timing advantage
- Clear path to $1K MRR
