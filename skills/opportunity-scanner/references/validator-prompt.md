# Validator Prompt Template (Phase 2: Roast)

Use this template when spawning Opus validators.

---

Validate or ROAST: **[IDEA NAME]**

## The Opportunity
- **Gap claimed:** [What gap was identified]
- **Payment evidence:** [What evidence exists]
- **Target price:** [Proposed pricing]
- **Build time claimed:** [Weeks]
- **Pre-roast check:** [What competitor research was done]

## Your Job: Try to KILL This Idea

Be brutally honest. Your job is to find reasons this will fail.

### Research Required

1. **Competitor Deep Dive**
   - Search "[problem] software" and "[problem] tool"
   - Check G2, Capterra, Product Hunt
   - List EVERY competitor with pricing
   - Check for free alternatives

2. **Payment Validation**
   - Are people ACTUALLY paying for solutions?
   - Or just complaining and using free tools?
   - Search for "[competitor] pricing" complaints

3. **Build Time Reality Check**
   - Is the claimed timeline realistic?
   - What's the actual scope?
   - Hidden complexity?

4. **Market Size**
   - Is this niche big enough for $1k MRR?
   - Or too small to matter?

5. **The Free Alternative Question**
   - Does a free tool solve 80% of this?
   - Browser extensions?
   - Built-in features in existing tools?

### ROAST If:
- Free alternatives exist that solve the problem
- Market saturated at the target price point
- Complainers are uninformed (better solutions exist)
- Build complexity is 3x+ what was claimed
- No actual payment evidence (just "I'd pay for this")
- A well-funded competitor owns this space

### VALIDATE Only If:
- Genuine gap that competitors don't fill
- Clear evidence of people paying for inferior solutions
- Realistic build scope
- Defensible niche or unique angle
- Clear path to $1k MRR

## Output

1. **VERDICT:** ✅ VALIDATED or ❌ ROASTED
2. **Confidence:** High / Medium / Low
3. **Competitor Matrix:** Every competitor with pricing
4. **If VALIDATED:**
   - MVP spec (exactly what to build week 1)
   - Go-to-market strategy
   - Key risks and mitigations
5. **If ROASTED:**
   - Specific reasons it fails
   - What complainers should actually use
   - Lesson learned for future scanning
6. **Update** ideas/RESEARCH-LOG.md with verdict
